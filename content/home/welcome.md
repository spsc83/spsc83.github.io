Dr. Srilakshmi (Sri) Raj is a population geneticist who aims to understand why disease risk varies among individuals and ethnically diverse populations. She investigates environmental-context dependent genetic variation and how it can be used to understand and predict complex disease in different global populations.

Clark and Dr. Prabhu Pingali at the Tata Cornell Institute. She is also a visiting scholar at the University of Pennsylvania Department of Genetics, mentored by Professor Sarah Tishkoff and holds an adjunct appointment at the Centre for Human Genetics in Bangalore, India. Prior to joining Cornell, Dr. Raj worked as a research assistant at Harvard Medical School with Professor Frederick Ausubel, completed her undergraduate degree at the University of Oxford and her Ph.D. degree at the University of Cambridge with Dr. Toomas Kivisild, with the support of a Gates Cambridge Scholarship.
