<h3>Why are certain subgroups of the human population more susceptible to certain disorders than others?</h3>
<p>Complex traits are caused by a combination of genes and environment. I use computational, anthropological, molecular and statistical approaches to understand how genetics acts in the context of environment and other non-genetic factors to produce a trait. This work has powerful public health implications, as different individuals and populations experience current changes in the environment in varied ways.</p>

<h3>Context-specific disease prediction in different ancestries</h3>
<p>I am using and developing machine learning methods to identify combinations of genetic and non-genetic risk factors that result in disease in large-scale genomic cohorts, such as the UK Biobank. Methods include adaptations of the Patient-Rule Induction Method (PRIM) (Dyson and Sing 2009) and machine learning models to predict complex disease outcomes, suck as heart disease, in males and females.</p>

<h3>Genetics and genomics of early childhood growth: stunting</h3>
<p>Stunting, or height-for-age that is >2 standard deviations below the global standard for children under 5 years of age, affects nearly 20% of children worldwide and nearly 38% of children in India, with some regions harboring >60% stunted children. Stunted growth research has largely centered on environmental causes. However, I am addressing the environmental, medical, genetic, epigenetic and metabolomic contexts in which stunting occurs, in different regions of India.</p>


<h3>Adaptation to environment in global populations</h3>
<p>Modern human phenotypic differences betray their adaptations to their local environments since they evolved in African around 3-200,000 years ago and emerged out of it from 50,000 years ago to populate the rest of the world. I study the causes and consequences of local adaptation in global populations. Disease susceptibility is a trait which varies across individuals and populations in susceptibility, mechanism and age of onset. Environment plays a major role in the distribution of genetic and non-genetic contributors to the variability of disease.The phenotypic traits I have focused on include: susceptibility to diabetes in Asian populations, susceptibility to hypertension in African populations, and evidence of climate- and diet-based adaptations in these and other populations.</p>
