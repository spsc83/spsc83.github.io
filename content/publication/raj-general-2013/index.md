abstract: "Background: Many efforts have been made to detect signatures of positive selection in the human genome,
especially those associated with expansion from Africa and subsequent colonization of all other continents.
However, most approaches have not directly probed the relationship between the environment and patterns of
variation among humans. We have designed a method to identify regions of the genome under selection based
on Mantel tests conducted within a general linear model framework, which we call MAntel-GLM to Infer Clinal
Selection (MAGICS). MAGICS explicitly incorporates population-specific and genome-wide patterns of background
variation as well as information from environmental values to provide an improved picture of selection and its
underlying causes in human populations.
Results: Our results significantly overlap with those obtained by other published methodologies, but MAGICS has
several advantages. These include improvements that: limit false positives by reducing the number of independent
tests conducted and by correcting for geographic distance, which we found to be a major contributor to selection
signals; yield absolute rather than relative estimates of significance; identify specific geographic regions linked most
strongly to particular signals of selection; and detect recent balancing as well as directional selection.
Conclusions: We find evidence of selection associated with climate (P < 10-5) in 354 genes, and among these
observe a highly significant enrichment for directional positive selection. Two of our strongest ‘hits’, however,
ADRA2A and ADRA2C, implicated in vasoconstriction in response to cold and pain stimuli, show evidence of
balancing selection. Our results clearly demonstrate evidence of climate-related signals of directional and balancing
selection."
