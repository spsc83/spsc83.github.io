abstract: "Expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) have been found to be enriched in trait-associated single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs).
However, whether eQTLs are adaptive to different environmental factors and its relative evolutionary significance compared with
nonsynonymous SNPs (NS SNPs) are still elusive. Compiling environmental correlation data from three studies formore than 500,000
SNPs and 42 environmental factors, including climate, subsistence, pathogens, and dietary patterns, we performed a systematic
examination of the adaptive patterns of eQTLs to local environment.Compared with intergenic SNPs, eQTLs are significantly enriched
in the lower tail of a transformed rank statistic in the environmental correlation analysis, indicating possible adaptation of eQTLs to the
majority of 42 environmental factors. The mean enrichment of eQTLs across 42 environmental factors is as great as, if not greater
than, thatofNS SNPs. The enrichmentof eQTLs, althoughsignificant across all levelsof recombinationrate, is inversely correlated with
recombination rate, suggesting the presence of selective sweep or background selection. Further pathway enrichment analysis
identified a number of pathways with possible environmental adaption from eQTLs. These pathways are mostly related with
immune function and metabolism. Our results indicate that eQTLs might have played an important role in recent and ongoing
human adaptation and are of special importance for some environmental factors and biological pathways."
