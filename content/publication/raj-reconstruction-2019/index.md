# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: "Domestication of crops and animals during the Holocene epoch played a critical role in
shaping human culture, diet and genetic variation. This domestication process took place
across a span of time and space, especially in Asia. We hypothesize that domestication
of plants and animals around the world must have influenced the human genome
differentially among human populations to a far greater degree than has been appreciated
previously. The range of domesticated foods that were available in different regions can
be expected to have created regionally distinct nutrient intake profiles and deficiencies.
To capture this complexity, we used archaeobotanical evidence to construct two models
of dietary nutrient composition over a 9000 year time span in Asia: one based on Larson
et al. (2014) and measured through composition of 8 nutrients, and another taking into
account a wider range of crops, cooking and lifestyle variation, and the dietary variables
glycemic index and carbohydrate content. We hypothesize that the subtle dietary shifts
through time and space have also influenced current human genetic variation among
Asians. We used statistical methods BayeScEnv, BayeScan and Baypass, to examine 
the impact of our reconstructed long-term dietary habits on genome-wide genetic variation
in 29 current-day Asian populations (Figure S1, Figure 1, Figure 2). Our results show that
genetic variation in diet-related pathways is correlated with dietary differences among
Asian populations. SNPs in five genes, GHR, LAMA1, SEMA3A, CAST and TCF7L2,
involved in the gene ontologies ‘salivary gland morphogenesis’ and ‘negative regulation
of type B pancreatic cell apoptotic process’ suggest that metabolism may have been
primary targets of selection driven by dietary shifts. These shifts may have influenced
biological pathways in ways that have a lasting impact on health. We present a case that
archaeobotanical evidence can provide valuable insight for understanding how historical
human niche construction might have influenced modern human genetic variation."
