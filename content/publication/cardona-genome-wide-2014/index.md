abstract: "Following the dispersal out of Africa, where hominins evolved in warm environments for millions of years, our species has
colonised different climate zones of the world, including high latitudes and cold environments. The extent to which human
habitation in (sub-)Arctic regions has been enabled by cultural buffering, short-term acclimatization and genetic
adaptations is not clearly understood. Present day indigenous populations of Siberia show a number of phenotypic features,
such as increased basal metabolic rate, low serum lipid levels and increased blood pressure that have been attributed to
adaptation to the extreme cold climate. In this study we introduce a dataset of 200 individuals from ten indigenous Siberian
populations that were genotyped for 730,525 SNPs across the genome to identify genes and non-coding regions that have
undergone unusually rapid allele frequency and long-range haplotype homozygosity change in the recent past. At least
three distinct population clusters could be identified among the Siberians, each of which showed a number of unique
signals of selection. A region on chromosome 11 (chr11:66â€“69 Mb) contained the largest amount of clustering of significant
signals and also the strongest signals in all the different selection tests performed. We present a list of candidate cold
adaption genes that showed significant signals of positive selection with our strongest signals associated with genes
involved in energy regulation and metabolism (CPT1A, LRP5, THADA) and vascular smooth muscle contraction (PRKG1). By
employing a new method that paints phased chromosome chunks by their ancestry we distinguish local Siberian-specific
long-range haplotype signals from those introduced by admixture."
