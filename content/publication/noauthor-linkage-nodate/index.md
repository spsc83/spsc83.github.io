abstract: "Variation at four single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) sites of the interleukin 1 (IL1) gene cluster was investigated among 280 unrelated individuals, representing 7 caste groups from the state of Karnataka, India, and one European American community of Boston, Massachusetts. Allele and haplotype frequencies, strength of linkage disequilibrium, and signatures of recombination varied considerably among populations. Variable community sizes and traditions of consanguinity may account for the observed variation."
