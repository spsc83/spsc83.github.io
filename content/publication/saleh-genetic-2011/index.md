abstract: "Background The genetic basis of the autoimmune disease type 1 diabetes
(T1D) has now been largely determined, so now we can compare these
findings with emerging genetic knowledge of disorders and phenotypes that
have been negatively or positively associated with T1D historically. Here, we
assessed the role in T1D of variants previously reported to be associated with
atopic diseases and epithelial barrier function, profilaggrin (FLG), and those
that affect the expression levels of the proinflammatory cytokines tumour
necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-1β, interferon (IFN)γ and IL-18.
Methods We genotyped single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs):
−105/rs28665122 in SELS or SEPS1 (selenoprotein), three single
nucleotide polymorphisms in IL18 (−105/rs360717, +183/rs5744292 and
+1467/rs574456) and R501X/rs61816761 in FLG, the major locus associated
with atopic dermatitis and predisposing to asthma, in a minimum of
6743 T1D cases and 7864 controls.
Results No evidence of T1D association was found for any of the SNPs
we genotyped at FLG, SELS or IL18 (p ≥ 0.03), nor with haplotypes of
IL18 (p = 0.82). Review of previous T1D genome-wide association results
revealed that four (human leucocyte antigen (HLA), gasdermin B/ORM1
(Saccharomyces cerevisiae)-like/gasdermin B/, GSDMB/ORMDL3/GSDMA and
IL2RB) of ten loci recently reported to be associated with asthma were
associated with T1D (p ≤ 0.005).
Conclusions These results show that there are shared genetic associations
for atopy-related traits and T1D, and this might help in the future to
understand the mechanisms, pathways and environmental factors that
underpin the rapid rise in incidence of both disorders in children.
