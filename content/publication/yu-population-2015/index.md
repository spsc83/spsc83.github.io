abstract: "Whole genome analysis in large samples from a single population is needed to provide adequate
power to assess relative strengths of natural selection across different functional
components of the genome. In this study, we analyzed next-generation sequencing data
from 962 European Americans, and found that as expected approximately 60% of the top
1% of positive selection signals lie in intergenic regions, 33% in intronic regions, and slightly
over 1% in coding regions. Several detailed functional annotation categories in intergenic
regions showed statistically significant enrichment in positively selected loci when compared
to the null distribution of the genomic span of ENCODE categories. There was a significant
enrichment of purifying selection signals detected in enhancers, transcription factor
binding sites, microRNAs and target sites, but not on lincRNA or piRNAs, suggesting different
evolutionary constraints for these domains. Loci in “repressed or low activity regions”
and loci near or overlapping the transcription start site were the most significantly over-represented
annotations among the top 1% of signals for positive selection."
