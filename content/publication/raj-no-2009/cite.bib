 abstract = {We used recently confirmed type 2 diabetes gene regions to investigate the genetic relationship between type 1 and type 2 diabetes, in an average of 7,606 type 1 diabetic individuals and 8,218 controls, providing \textgreater80% power to detect effects as small as an OR of 1.11 at a false-positive rate of 0.003.},
