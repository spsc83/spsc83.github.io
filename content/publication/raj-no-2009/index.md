abstract: "Aims/hypothesis We used recently confirmed type 2 diabetes
gene regions to investigate the genetic relationship
between type 1 and type 2 diabetes, in an average of 7,606
type 1 diabetic individuals and 8,218 controls, providing
>80% power to detect effects as small as an OR of 1.11 at a
false-positive rate of 0.003.
Methods The single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)
with the most convincing evidence of association in 12
type 2 diabetes-associated gene regions, PPARG, CDKAL1,
HNF1B, WFS1, SLC30A8, CDKN2A–CDKN2B, IGF2BP2,
KCNJ11, TCF7L2, FTO, HHEX–IDE and THADA, were
analysed in type 1 diabetes cases and controls. PPARG and
HHEX–IDE were additionally tested for association in
3,851 type 1 diabetes families. Tests for interaction with
HLA class II genotypes, autoantibody status, sex, and ageat-
diagnosis of type 1 diabetes were performed with all 12
gene regions.
Results Only PPARG and HHEX–IDE showed any evidence
of association with type 1 diabetes cases and controls (p=
0.004 and p=0.003, respectively; p>0.05 for other SNPs).
The potential association of PPARG was supported by family
analyses (p=0.003; pcombined=1.0×10−4). No SNPs showed
evidence of interaction with any covariate (p>0.05).
Conclusions/interpretation We found no convincing genetic
link between type 1 and type 2 diabetes. An association
of PPARG (rs1801282/Pro12Ala) could be consistent with
its known function in inflammation. Hence, our results
reinforce evidence suggesting that type 1 diabetes is a
disease of the immune system, rather than being due to
inherited defects in beta cell function or regeneration or
insulin resistance."
