abstract: "Childhood stunting remains a prominent metric in the
health and development of modern India. In Karnataka,
India, districts vary substantially in stunting prevalence.
Here we take a close look at the nature of childhood
stunting in the state: its epidemiology, genetics,
biology, nutritional basis, environmental contribution,
policy and field-based understanding. We explore how
these factors interact with one another, and suggest
ways to target modifiable risk factors for stunting (e.g.
nutrition, exposure to infectious diseases, sanitation),
which may influence the impact of non-modifiable
risk factors (e.g. congenital factors, climate). We suggest
that programmes designed to reduce stunting
prevalence should accommodate these complex interactions,
which could translate to more substantial
impact on child health outcomes."
