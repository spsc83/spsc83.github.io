abstract: "The extent of genetic variation and the degree of genetic differentiation among seven ethnic populations from Karnataka,
India (Bunt, Havyak, Iyengar, Lingayath, Smartha, Vaishya, Vokkaliga), was investigated using four single nucleotide polymorphisms
(SNPs: IL-1A 4845, IL-1B 3954, IL-1B 511 and IL-1RA 2018) of the interleukin gene cluster. Allele frequencies
varied by threefold among these populations, which also differed for gene diversity and heterozygosity levels. The average
degree of population subdivision among these castes was low (FST = 0.02). However, pair-wise interpopulation differentiation
ranged from 0â€“7%, indicating no detectable differentiation to moderate differentiation between specific populations. The
results of phylogenetic analysis based on genetic distances between populations agreed with known social and cultural data
on these ethnic groups. Variation in the allele frequencies, as well as differentiation, may be attributed to differential selection
and demographic factors including consanguinity among the ethnic groups. Information on the distribution of functionally
relevant polymorphisms among ethnic populations may be important towards developing community medicine and public
health policies."
